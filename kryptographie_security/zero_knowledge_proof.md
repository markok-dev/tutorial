### Infos
- alternative way of sharing data
- provide companies with the data they need witout revealing the data.  
- proofing, something is true witout revealing the thing we are proffing.  

### Example
i have a friend who is color blind.  
i want to proof him, that two balls has different colors.  
he cant recognize the difference of the balls (color blind).  

-> he switch the balls behind his back. and i cann tell, wheter he switched them or not.  
the probability, that we guess the right color is 1/2 - so we must repeat that process.  
__is never 100% prooven, but near 100%__  

thats it:  
we have proofen our friend, hat the balls are have different colors - but he dont know the colors (zero knowledge).   



### Two forms of Zero Knowledge Proof
- Interactive and Non-interactive  

##### Interactive
The example above is Non-interactive.  


##### Non-interactive

SNARK = Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge  

succinct = prägnant / kurz und bündig / knapp
